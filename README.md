#Game Lang
-------------

GameLang is a Python based high level programming language specifically oriented torwards newbie game developers wanting to produce 2D, cross-platform experiences for players around the world.

## Technologies Used

GameLang is based on Python 3.4.2. GameLang is built upon multiple Python libraries, the most notable being Pygame and Pymunk, with future support for PyOpenGL. Pygame is used for drawing, playing audio, and handling input.

## Hello World in GameLang

	print "Hello, World!"
	x is "Hello, World!"
	print x
	
Lets go through this program, line by line:

`print "Hello, World!"`, this, unsuprisingly prints out Hello, World!
`x is "Hello, World!"`, this creates a new variable called `x`, with the value of `Hello, World!`.
`print x`, this prints x to the console
